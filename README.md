# JS30

### A repo containing projects from Wes Bos' course on VanillaJS coding challenges & projects.

With this course I purposefully tried to venture off from simply the given material - I have created my own styles for some projects, building all the code from the ground up instead
of simply using the open-source templates available. I've also added features to projects to my own liking, and taken some further than simply working on them for one day.
